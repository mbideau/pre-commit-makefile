# pre-commit-makefile

Useful Git hooks when using Makefiles such as generating documentation in README.md.

It uses [Yelp's pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com) framework for adding git hooks locally.

## Dependencies

* [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html)
* [`perl`](https://www.perl.org/)
* [`git`](https://github.com/git/git)

## Usage

### Step 1: Install the pre-commit package (MAC OS)

```bash
brew install pre-commit
```

_For operating systems, other than macOS, check the [official documentation](http://pre-commit.com/#install)_.

### Step 2: Add the following to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```bash
cat <<EOF > .pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: git://github.com/mbideau/pre-commit-makefile
  rev: master
  hooks:
    - id: makefile-doc
EOF
```

### Step 3: Install the git pre-commit hook to your local project

```bash
pre-commit install
```

If you want to run the checks on-demand (outside of git hooks), run after you when through the setup below:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --verbose
```

### Step 4: Create a Makefile and define a `make help` target

Define `make help` target that outputs a list of targets with documentation. You can follow the self-documenting [Makefile](http://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html) format or take the starter [test/Makefile](test/Makefile).

### Step 5: Add Markers in README.md

Add the following markers to the README.md files that are in the same directory as the Makefile:

`<!-- START makefile-doc -->`

`<!-- END makefile-doc -->`

`makefile-doc` will add or update documentation generated by `make help` between the markers in the README.md files that are located in the same folder as the Makefile.

It will only scan for files named strictly `Makefile` in the all directories and insert the documentation into `README.md` files in the same directories.
